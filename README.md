# php-form-builder

Forms are annoying. You have to 1) code them, 2) populate them, 3) validate them, 4) make them look pretty.


## Overview

1) Make form building fun again by providing a OO and concise helper class.

2) Throw $_POST (or whatever) at it and make it stick to the correct elements.

3) Set validation rules per element and alert users to their foolish mistakes.

4) Bootstrap. Nuff said.


## Demo

Run index.php in your browser to see and interact with a dummy form.
